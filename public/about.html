<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from Caltech in 2020 with degrees in Computer Science and Business, Economics, and Management (BEM). While there,
  I played 4 years on the Men's Basketball Team and was a team captain for 3 of those seasons. While in college, I completed software
   engineering internships at Intel and Goldman Sachs.

<p>Upon graduating, I joined a stealth startup called Lumi Labs, which shortly afterward was renamed to Sunshine Products. I played an integral role
  at Sunshine in launching our 2 consumer iOS apps, Sunshine Contacts and Sunshine Birthdays. On the Contacts app, I was primarily responsible for the
  backend implementation of the majority of user actions. My responsibilities were to drive latencies down and provide pleasant user experiences with 
  proper server handling. I was the lead backend engineer on the Birthdays app handling the scheduling and sending of all notifications, implementing 
  the flower and gift order backend with Stripe API payment confirmation and in-house address verification, and the import of contacts from Contacts, Calendar,
  and Facebook.

<p>I'm passionate about using my technical skills to make an impact on society. I enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative environments. Aside from technical challenges,
  I'm also very interested in the business side of things and enjoy wearing many hats in the process of developing innovative products.
